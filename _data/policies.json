The law makes major investments in surface transportation, including rail and public transit, and climate resilient infrastructure. It also supports expansion of electricity transmission and CO2 pipeline networks, funds building weatherization and EV charger stations, and invests in demonstration and early deployment of a range of advanced energy technologies. <em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X2PORZp5JzP2yWbdUSbXphElIGPEOlJNI-T12gz7n1s/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> for a complete list of policies and description of how they were modeled in REPEAT Project analysis.</em>"

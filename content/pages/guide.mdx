### Create your site

Create a gatsby site using this starter with:

```
gatsby new my-website https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/gatsby-starter-hypersite
```

Run the site in development mode by navigating to the folder and running

```
npm run develop
```

</Block>

### Configure your site

Site-wide configuration is managed through the `/config/metadata.json` file. Open this file to view the configuration

---

#### Create your site navigation structure

1. Edit the `menuLinks` property of the metadata object to create your site navigation structure. You can create nested levels of navigation by adding a `subMenu` property to an entry.
1. Save the file and restart the development server to see your changes (`npm run develop`)

##### Example site navigation configuration

```js
{
  // ...
  "menuLinks": [
    {
      "name": "About Us",
      "link": "/about-us",
      // nested items
      "subMenu" : [
        {
          "name": "Who We Are",
          "link": "/about-us/who-we-are"
        },
        {
          "name": "Careers",
          "link": "/about-us/Careers"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Styles",
      "link": "/styles"
    },
    {
      "name": "Guide",
      "link": "/guide"
    }
  ],
  //...
}
```

---

#### Configure the default metadata

The default metadata defines what page titles, descriptions, and social images will be used by default if values are not provided at the page level.

1. open `/config/metadata.json`
2. edit the `siteUrl`, `title`, `description`, `keywords`, and `image` properties to set default values for the site
3. save the file, restart the dev server to see changes

> the social image for the site should be placed in the `static` folder (e.g. `/static/images/social.png`). Anything in the `/static` folder will be copied to the root directory of your website, so you can reference this image as `/images/social.png`.

---

##### Example metadata configuration

```js
{
  "siteUrl": "https://gatsby-starter-hypersite.netlify.app",
  "title": "Hypersite",
  "description": "Hypersite is a gatsby starter to help get started quick.",
  "keywords": ["gatsby", "theme", "react"],
  "image": "/image/social.jpg", // file placed in `/static/image/social.jpg`
  // ...
}
```

---

#### Configure other metadata (optional)

You can also set additional parameters in your metadata, like social media account or a copyright notice. Below is the full list of metadata supported in the `gatsby-theme-hypersite`:

| key           | value                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Create Pages

For each page in your site's navigation structure, ensure there is also a corresponding page in `/content/pages`.

Each page has frontmatter with configuration for the page and body content that follows.

---

#### Frontmatter

##### Setting the page URL

use the `path` key to configure the path (or "slug") that determines where the page is accessed on your website.

**Example:** create the page at https://your-website.com/guide

```toml
path: /guide
```

##### Turning on "draft" Status

use the `draft` key to configure whether the page should be created in the production environment or not. When `draft` is set to `true`, the page will not be created in a production environment but will be created in development or staging environments.

**Example:** do not publish in production

```toml
draft: true
```

##### Creating an alias URL for a page (redirect)

use the `alias` key to provide an alternate URL that will direct to this page.

**Example:** page is created at https://your-website.com/guide and the page https://your-website.com/getting-started redirects to it.

```toml
path: /guide
alias: /getting-started
```

##### Setting the page metadata (title, description, social image, etc.)

```toml
meta:
  title: Hypercore
  keywords: gatsby, react
  description: A starter theme for gatsby
  image: ./hello.jpg
```

##### Setting images to use in page content

```toml
embeddedImages:
  - ./image1.jpg
  - ./image2.jpg
  - ./image3.jpg
```

---

#### Page Content

##### Using custom components

You can import your own custom components on a per-page basis by adding an import statement at the top of the body content for the page.

If you would like to add the ability to use a custom component across all pages without the need to import, shadow the `mdx.js` file from gatsby-theme-hypercore and include the desired components.

##### Using a different layout

You can export a component from an MDX file to use it as the layout for the page.

See [defining a layout](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/writing-pages/#defining-a-layout) in th [MDX guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/writing-pages/).

### Theming

---

#### Colors, Typography, Margins, Shadows, etc.

Customize the shadowed theme in `/src/gatsby-theme-hypercore/theme.js` to set breakpoints, colors, typography, layout, shadows.

- See the [theming section of the material-ui docs](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/) for details on customizing.
- Refer to the [default theme](https://material-ui.com/customization/default-theme/) to explore all values provided by the material ui theme.
- Look at [global theme overrides](https://material-ui.com/customization/components/#global-theme-override) to see how you can customize the appearance of any material ui components in use
- Use [material-ui/styles](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/#material-ui-styles) for styling components

---

#### Adding Custom Web Fonts

TODO

- Google fonts
- Typekit
- Typography.com
- Self-hosted

---

#### Customizing Layout (Header, Footer, etc.)

Use [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/) to override [components from the gatsby-theme-hypersite](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/gatsby-themes/tree/main/themes/gatsby-theme-hypersite/src) theme.

> For example: create your own header in `/src/gatsby-theme-hypersite/header/header.js` to replace the theme's header with your own.

- See [gatsby-theme-hypersite](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/gatsby-themes/tree/main/themes/gatsby-theme-hypersite/src) to see the components that can be shadowed
- See [gatsby-theme-hypercore](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/gatsby-themes/tree/main/themes/gatsby-theme-hypercore/src) to see which core components can be shadowed

### Content Management

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is used for content management, common modules and documentation are in the works.

For now, follow [DRY Netlify CMS config with manual initialization](https://mrkaluzny.com/blog/dry-netlify-cms-config-with-manual-initialization/) for a guide on how to configure the CMS for use with gatsby

This includes evaluation of candidate sites for wind and solar development, thermal power plant siting and repowering, and transmission expansion as well as associated impacts on air quality and labor/employment.</p>

          These tools were employed to great impact in the Princeton Net-Zero America study, which “set an entirely new standard” in energy transition modeling by offering an “unprecedented degree of clarity and granularity” in its results, according to John Holdren, former Science Advisor to President Obama and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The spatially-explicit and granular results and associated maps have proven to be highly relevant to a wide range of stakeholders and decision makers, and the responses to the report indicate the desire for more politically-salient outputs from energy systems models.
